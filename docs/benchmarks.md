# Benchmarks

Currently, we support C++/CPP 14 programs.
The `test_data` directory contains various CPP code fragments and also some student projects written in CPP.

A set of C++ projects we run CodA on them as the benchmark are available in the [Benchmark repository](https://github.com/m-zakeri/benchmark).
